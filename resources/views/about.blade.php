                Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Don't worry. As long as
                you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning
                strikes the tower, everything will be fine. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information
                about
                the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire
                drastically.
                Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Marty you gotta come
                back
                with me. What a nightmare. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night.
                Are
                you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some
                scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? McFly. Well yeah, you know
                we
                have two of them. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is
                exactly
                one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one
                gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Well, Marty, I
                want
                to thank you for all your good advise, I'll never forget it. George, help me, please. What, what is it
                hot?
                What, I don't get what happened. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. You okay, is everything
                alright? Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Don't worry. As long as you hit that
                wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the
                tower,
                everything will be fine. She's just trying to keep you respectable. Well uh, good, fine. George McFly?
                Oh,
                he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself,
                and
                protect the woman he loves. Don't you? He's an absolute dream. You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay
                for
                it. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? That's right.
                Wait a
                minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Ah well, sort of. I have to tell you
                about
                the future. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries
                whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like
                meatloaf.
                Right. Precisely. I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Yeah, I'm- mayor.
                Now
                that's a good idea. I could run for mayor. Bet your ass it works. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.
                It's
                a board with wheels. Doc? Right. Ahh. Well gee, I don't know. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my
                entire
                life. Okay. No, bastards. I have to tell you about the future. God dammit, I'm late. What's the meaning
                of
                this. Where the hell are they. George: you ever think of running for class president? Marty, such a nice
                name. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close
                the
                door and beat it. Never? How about a ride, Mister? Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my
                stories. You have this thing hooked up to the car? Say that again. About how far ahead are you going?
                Marty,
                you made it. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I
                didn't
                have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?
                Aw
                yeah, everything is great. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett
                Brown.
                I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m.
                and
                this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go,
                get
                down, that's it. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. What a nightmare. Let him go,
                Biff, you're drunk.
