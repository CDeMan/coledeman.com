            <p>Hi, I'm Cole DeMan and I'm a Computer Science student at Dalhousie University. Currently I'm planning
                on finishing my Bachelors of Computer Science in December of 2016. This is a website I've created to
                act as a custom web presence for myself and hopefully show I have skills as a web designer.</p>

            <p>During my studies at Dalhousie I have learnt a lot of skills, from C to Designing User Interfaces. I've
                had a lot of experience working in teams for Agile Development.</p>

            <p>One example of my agile experience can be seen in <a href="/about/ui_report">
                    this report</a> on a final project designing a user interface. We went through many iterations and
                design
                for although there was no actual code created for this project our team met several times a week for 4
                months
                developing this user interface using an agile/S.C.R.U.M process. We also performed user testing to find
                flaws and improve our design. It was a great experience for learning how to work as a team and gaining a
                strong understanding of how to design an interface for users.

            <p>Atque his de rebus et splendida est eorum et illustris oratio. Quid enim de amicitia statueris utilitatis
                causa expetenda vides. Si verbum sequimur, primum longius verbum praepositum quam bonum. Qui non
                moveatur et offensione turpitudinis et comprobatione honestatis? Age sane, inquam. Sic enim censent,
                oportunitatis esse beate vivere. Sed tamen est aliquid, quod nobis non liceat, liceat illis. At iste non
                dolendi status non vocatur voluptas. </p>

            <p>Vestri haec verecundius, illi fortasse constantius. Reguli reiciendam; Videsne quam sit magna dissensio?
                Atqui iste locus est, Piso, tibi etiam atque etiam confirmandus, inquam; Nec vero alia sunt quaerenda
                contra Carneadeam illam sententiam. At, si voluptas esset bonum, desideraret. Nam Pyrrho, Aristo,
                Erillus iam diu abiecti. Tibi hoc incredibile, quod beatissimum. </p>
