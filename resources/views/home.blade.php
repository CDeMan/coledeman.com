                C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you
                want me
                to give it to you. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by
                terrorists.
                Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.
                That's
                a great idea. I'd love to park. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five
                minutes
                slow. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? We're gonna take a
                little
                break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. C'mon. Oh honey, he's teasing you,
                nobody
                has two television sets. Nothing. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll
                tape,
                we'll proceed. No. Oh, just a little weather experiment. Well, this is a radiation suit. Wait a minute,
                Doc.
                What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?
                Doc.
                Oh. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you
                been
                doing all day? Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Good evening, I'm
                Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- I still don't understand, how am I supposed
                to
                go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. What you got under here? Yeah.
                When
                could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future. No, Biff, you leave her alone. Alright,
                McFly,
                you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. He's a peeping tom. Dad. Yeah, well history is gonna
                change. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the
                Enchantment
                Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in
                1985. I
                got a girl. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot
                before
                when I would drive it. Hi, son. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Yeah,
                sure,
                okay. Mom, is that you? Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have
                hair? That's good advice, Marty. Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing
                that
                comes to your mind. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.
                What
                you got under here? What? You okay, is everything alright? Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm
                your
                density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Wow, you must be rich. He's an
                absolute
                dream. Calvin. I haven't Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't
                be so
                gullible, McFly. Uh, look me up when you get there. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that
                it's
                been educational. The flux capacitor. Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. Can't be. This is nuts. Aw,
                c'mon.
                But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it
                in to
                the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. You do? C'mon. Believe me, Marty, you're better off
                not
                having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. Hey not too early I
                sleep
                in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. It's about the future, isn't
                it?
                Biff. You know what I do in those situations? Next, please. Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny.
                Hey
                you guys are being real mature. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common
                interests, what do they like to do together? What about George? Thanks a lot, kid. Wait a minute. Wait a
                minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta
                have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting?
                I'd
                get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Hey not too early I
                sleep
                in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Stop it. George McFly? Oh,
                he's
                kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and
                protect
                the woman he loves. Don't you? Oh. George: you ever think of running for class president? Yeah well, I
                saw
                it on a rerun. About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again
                of
                your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Wait a minute, wait a
                minute,
                Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Alright, let's set your
                destination
                time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like
                you
                never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've
                calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at
                exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Wait a minute. Wait a
                minute,
                Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet. Pa, what is it?
                What
                is it, Pa? Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or
                Craig
                called you just a little while ago. Yeah, it's 8:00. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.
                Just
                turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Uncle Jailbird Joey?
                My
                god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I
                don't
                know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? He laid out Biff in one
                punch.
                I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Alright, okay. Alright, there she
                is,
                George. Just go in there and invite her. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take
                advantage
                of them. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Are those my clocks I hear? What a
                nightmare. It's my dad. Holy shit. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? Give me a hand,
                Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything
                anything about you. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Which one's your pop? You have
                this
                thing hooked up to the car? Actually, people call me Marty. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I
                met
                your father. Marty, such a nice name. C'mon. Ah well, sort of. Who are you? Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown,
                Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- What? Well gee, I don't know. It's
                information
                about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Hello.
                Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. Right. Well, because George, nice girls get
                angry
                when guys take advantage of them. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like
                that,
                and we can't play without him. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to
                you. McFly. We do now. Yet. Look, you gotta listen to me. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that
                anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is
                exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time.
                Come
                here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where
                you're
                going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination
                time
                on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth
                or
                Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November
                5,
                1955. Alright, I'm ready. Ah well, sort of. Ronald Reagon. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.
                Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. That's Calvin Klein,
                oh
                my god, he's a dream. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the
                vision
                of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when
                this
                was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea
                about breeding pine trees. No. Alright, punk, now- Doc. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your
                density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Right. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What is she said
                no?
                I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody
                else.
                That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Mother, with
                Marty's
                parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with
                the
                car. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin. C'mon, c'mon. Right,
                and
                where am I gonna be? It's my dad. Whoa, this is heavy. I got enough practical jokes for one evening.
                Good
                night, future boy. Uh, I think so. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He
                never
                stood up to Biff in his life. Yeah. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic,
                this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Okay. You don't understand. Biff. Great good,
                good,
                Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age
                I
                never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're
                breaking
                his arm. Biff, stop. George. George. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Why thank you, Marty. George.
                Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order
                something.
                No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? Doc, is that a de- I can't believe you loaned me a car,
                without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what
                Dad
                was doing in the middle of the street. Right. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not
                leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious
                reprocautions on future events. Do you understand? It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit
                him,
                then none of you would have been born. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. What did your mother ever see
                in
                that kid? I have a feeling too. Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me
                give
                you the number. Bye. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's
                already going to the dance with you. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. What, well you mean like a
                date? We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Marty,
                I'm
                sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is
                a
                bolt of lightning. You'll find out in thirty years. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having
                information
                about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire
                drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Say that
                again. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Go. Yeah, it's in the back.
                Doc,
                look, all we need is a little plutonium. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good
                morning, Dave, Lynda Marty, that was very interesting music. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll
                be
                about 47. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Well uh, good, fine.
                Doc.
                My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I
                don't
                know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that
                thing
                I'm wearing? What did your mother ever see in that kid? Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh,
                McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have
                you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking
                at,
                butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil.
                Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking. Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. Next,
                please. I'll get it back to you, alright? Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. I over
                slept,
                look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine
                out
                but I don't know how to do it. What? What? Marty, are you alright? Marty, don't go this way.
                Strickland's
                looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. C'mon man, let's do something that
                really
                cooks. Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.
                Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it
                you
                could accomplish anything. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. Well, bring her along. This
                concerns
                her too. Yeah, where does he live? I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you
                were
                all great. See you all later, much later. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Yeah, sure,
                okay. Quiet. Marty, that was very interesting music. Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and
                make sure that he takes her to the dance. That's a big bruise you have there. Just relax now Calvin,
                you've
                got a big bruise on you're head. Biff. Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this
                sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of
                electricity that I need. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I
                didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. Hey, George, buddy,
                you
                weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you
                to,
                Lorraine. What are you writing? Wait a minute.
